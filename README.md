# Containerized App Exercise

This was an exericse to build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## 
This project is an extension of our [first specification project](https://github.com/software-students-spring2024/1-specification-exercise-bestswegroup) and [second project](https://github.com/software-students-spring2024/2-web-app-exercise-bswe) which defined and implemented a bill splitting web app.

In this project, we redesigned the frontend, containerized the web app and database, and added an OCR machine learning container for receipt scanning.
